# bankSimulation
In this project I simulated a bank, in which customers are coming to bank and sit in a queue. The time between arriving of the customers comes from a distribution. The money they give or receive comes from normal distribution.
The parameters are given from some files.
# bank_employee.txt:
Every line is for an employee and parts are splitted by SPACE. Each part is for a special work and shows the possibility of the time that employee will do the work.
# comming_time.txt:
The time in minute that takes for arriving a customer after the last one and their possibilities.
# possible_work.txt:
The possibilty of choosing every work from a customer.
# normal.txt:
Parameters of the normal distribution, from which the amount of money every customer gives or recieves comes from.
